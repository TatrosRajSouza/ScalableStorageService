How to use the ECS:

1- Running the ECS:
	Run the ant script.
	call the ECS from the terminal passing the configuration file as an argument: 'java -jar ms3-ecs.jar ecs.config'

2- Initializing some server nodes:
	This runs the server node. The server node can't receive client request yet.
	'initService <numberOfNodes>'
	
3- Starting the service
	After initializing you have to start the server nodes.
	'start'

4- Adding a new server node
	It initializes and start the node. If you initialized all the nodes you wanted and started the service there
	is no need to use this procedure.
	'addNode'
	
5- Removing a server node that is running
	It stops completely the server node, even the process.
	'removeNode'	
	
6- Stopping the service
	Make all the servers idle. The servers will not receive client communication until 'start' is called again.
	'stop' 
	
7- Shutting down the service
	Removes all the servers, shutting them down. It doesn't leave the ECS program.
	'shutDown'

We don't decide which node will be initialized, started or removed,
since the specification asked us to make it randomly.

There are also commands that weren't asked like: 'help', 'quit' and 'logLevel'. They work like in the last milestone.
